<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Getting Started

This project was a way to get hands-on experience with GraphQL and Redux and was quite a jump for me in terms of learning. That's why I kept the layout and fields fetched to a minimum. 
Delivering an MVP of an anime list gave me a solid understanding of those two frameworks and it was my first project fully written in typescript too ! 

#### To use : 

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Alex969/Anime-List.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Run build on localhost
   ```
   npm start
   ```
